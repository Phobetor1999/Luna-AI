What the code does:

Audio recording: The record_audio method activates the microphone and saves the audio data to a WAV file. You can adjust the recording duration using the duration parameter.
Speaker identification: After recording the audio, the identify_speaker method simulates a speaker recognition process. If the speaker has already been registered, the system proceeds with transcribing the audio.
Processing and transcription: If the speaker is recognized, the audio file is passed to the HandleSelfStimuli method, which uses the Whisper model to transcribe the text.
Handling external stimuli: The HandleExternalStimuli method triggers audio recording, identifies the speaker, and, if the speaker is already recognized, calls HandleSelfStimuli for transcription.
Considerations:

Speaker recognition is still a placeholder and must be implemented using a speaker recognition system (e.g., with models like pyAudio or SpeechBrain).
Audio is recorded for a duration defined by INPUT_AUDIO_SENSOR_MAX_RECORD_DURATION (default is 5 seconds).
Whisper processes WAV files and returns a transcription.
